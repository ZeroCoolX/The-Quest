# The Quest
I began development on The Quest some time ago. It was my first experience into a larger scale 3D game dev world so I did as much as I could as fast as I could, which proved to be a bit of a problem. The Quest is currently on hold at the moment due to "biting off too much to chew with just myself" - meaning that as I kept adding more and more features and making the world larger and larger, it because harder and harder to manage and maintain by myself. 
That being said, the game is not dead, just currently halted because I do not have the time nor resources to continue it as other smaller game development projects have called for my attention.

The attached link above is a playlist of videos I posted a while back while development was being conducted so you can see that it is very much alive and well, just sitting in the back waiting to be re-awoken
